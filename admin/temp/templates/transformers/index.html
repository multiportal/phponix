<li><strong><a name="section1"></a>1. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></li>
<li><strong>Note to Parents</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Some of our Apps involve strategic gameplay and are directed toward experienced gamers, and some are intended for general audiences. We recognize that children may enjoy playing some of our general audience Apps and include age gates in those experiences. When a user indicates that the user is under 13 years old through an in-App age gate, we do not request that the user provide personal information to us or otherwise collect personal information from the user through that App, except as described below in this “<a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section1"><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></a>” section.</p>
<p><strong>The Types of Information We Collect From Children</strong></p>
<p>We make efforts to avoid collecting personal information from children, except in those instances under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and COPPA Rule or other applicable laws where personal information may be collected without parental consent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information Children Provide</strong>. We collect information that children provide to us in-App for feedback or to contact us (for support, for example). If children provide any personal information in queries or support requests, we use that information solely to assist them in response to the applicable query or support request.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information We Automatically Collect From Children’s Devices</strong>. When children use one of our Apps, we automatically collect certain information to enable the App to operate, including the following:</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The<strong> Device ID </strong>(or “<strong>DID</strong>“) associated with the device used to access the App. We may store the DID or another unique ID that we generate for an App installation with a child’s contact information when the child contacts us for support.</li>
<li><strong>IP address</strong></li>
<li><strong>MAC address</strong></li>
<li><strong>Open Device Identification Number (or ODIN)</strong></li>
<li><strong>The general location of the device the child is using</strong> (country and state level) from the device’s network</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also collect some general information from a child’s device such as <strong>device type, operating system, application software, </strong>and other metadata (such as timestamps) about use of the App and may connect it with the DID or other information described above.</p>
<p>Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, and by third parties as explained further under the “<strong>Information We Collect About Children From Third Parties” </strong>heading below in this “<a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section1"><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></a>” section.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information We Collect About Children From Third Parties</strong>. We work with a number of companies that provide analytics services regarding use of our Apps. We may share children’s DIDs or other information with those companies, or enable them to collect children’s DIDs or other information to analyze the use of our Apps for us. When a user indicates that the user is under 13 years old through an in-App age gate, we make efforts to limit the analytics information collected to information associated with when the App is opened.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Children’s Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We use children’s information collected through our Apps as described above, and to otherwise support the internal operation of our Apps. For example, we use this information to track available in-App currency, to save gameplay levels, and to permit access to gameplay across different devices. Our Apps do not display advertising to users who have indicated they are under 13.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other Sections Applicable To Children’s Information</strong>. The following sections of this Privacy Policy also apply to children who use our Apps, and the information that we collect from them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section4">4. Who We Share Your Information With</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section5">5. Our Legal Basis For Processing Your Information (for EEA visitors)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section6">6. How We Keep Your Information Secure</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section7">7. International Data Transfers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section8">8. How Long We Keep Your Information</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section9">9. Your Choices and Rights To Your Information</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section10">10. Your California Privacy Rights</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section11">11. Changes To This Privacy Policy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section12">12. How To Contact Us</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><a name="section2"></a><strong>2. THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Information You Provide</strong></p>
<p>We collect any information that you provide directly to us through use of one or more of our Apps, whether you provide that information through gameplay or other in-App interactions, such as contacting us for support, providing feedback about App features or functionality, or responding to a survey. This information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Your email address</li>
<li>Country of origin</li>
<li>Your survey responses</li>
<li>Your feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also collect your age in some of our Apps to determine whether you are old enough for certain App features. If you indicate that you are under 13, the App features that we make available to you are slightly different and governed by the <a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section1"><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></a> section above.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Automatically Collect</strong></p>
<p>When you use one of our Apps we automatically collect certain information, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your Device ID</strong> (or “<strong>DID</strong>“). This is a unique identifier for the device you use to access our Apps, and is used to build a picture about the person associated with the DID. We may store your DID or another unique ID that we generate for an App installation with your contact information when you contact us for support.</li>
<li><strong>Your IP address</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your Advertising ID </strong>(or “<strong>ADID</strong>“). This is a unique ID that your device’s operating system provides that we and our advertising service providers use to show you relevant ads in some of our Apps.</li>
<li><strong>Your Game Store ID</strong>. This is the ID associated with your account with the platform provider of the app store accessible via your device.</li>
<li><strong>Your Device’s MAC address</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your Device’s Open Device Identification Number (or ODIN)</strong>. This is a unique ID related to your device’s MAC address.</li>
<li><strong>Unique IDs assigned to you by our analytics and advertising service providers</strong>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section13"><strong>“Information We Collect From Third Parties”</strong></a> section below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IDs associated with your accounts by Social Networking Services</strong>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section13"><strong>“Information We Collect From Third Parties”</strong></a> section below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Your general location</strong> (country and state level) from your device’s network.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also collect some general information from your device such as <strong>device type, operating system, application software version, </strong>and other metadata (such as timestamps) about your use of our Apps and may connect that information with your DID or the other information described above.</p>
<p>If you make any in-App purchases for yourself or your child, we also automatically collect or receive information related to those purchases from the platform provider (e.g., Apple or Google). This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name, Game Store ID, or other ID associated with your account with the platform provider</li>
<li>The item purchased</li>
<li>The name of the App you were visiting</li>
<li>Confirmation from the app store of completion of purchase</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, and by third parties as explained further under the heading <a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section13"><strong>“Information We Collect From Third Parties”</strong></a> below.</p>
<p>Our Apps may also periodically examine the contents of your device to determine the presence of other Backflip Apps on the device. The Apps transmit the results of that examination to Backflip and our advertising service providers to be used in targeting advertisements to your device. For example, if you have PaperToss and NinJump installed on your device, when you play PaperToss, we will not send you ads for NinJump and will instead send you other, more relevant ads. When you start or stop an App, it may display an ad, and during gameplay a rotating banner ad may be displayed.</p>
<p>We may also automatically collect information related to the overall effectiveness of our advertising campaigns via our advertisements delivered on third party websites, apps and services (“<strong>Our Ads</strong>”).&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, we may collect information related to the number of people who click on Our Ads, and the number of people who download one of our Apps or other products via Our Ads. We may combine the information we collect via Our Ads with other information we collect via our Apps.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="section13"></a>Information We Collect From Third Parties</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We work with a number of third parties who collect information via our Apps, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Networking Sites</strong>. If you use one of our Apps in connection with a social networking site (such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google+) (each, a “<strong>Social Networking Site</strong>”), we may receive information about you from such Social Networking Site, in accordance with such Social Networking Site’s terms of use and privacy policy (“<strong>SNS Terms</strong>”) and your privacy settings with them. For instance, if you associate an App with your Facebook account, Facebook provides the App with information which may include your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends, email address, location, birthday and publishing stream, and other information you store on Facebook.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the App. If you elect to share information you have provided to us or that we have collected from you with these Social Networking Sites, we share information with them in accordance with your election in the App. The SNS Terms apply to the information we disclose to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong>. We may share your DID or other information with companies that provide analytics services regarding use of our Apps (or enable such companies to collect your DID or other information) to analyze use of the Apps for us, and for advertising about Backflip and other companies. These companies may combine information we provide to them or allow them to collect from or about you with information they collect in connection with other websites or applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third Party Offers or Activities</strong>. Our Apps may provide you access to third party services that offer in-App rewards in exchange for your participation in the third party’s offer or activity (each an “<strong>Activity</strong>”). If you click on or otherwise participate in any Activity, the third party(ies) providing the Activity may automatically collect certain information about you and your participation in the Activity. We recommend that you review the privacy policy(ies) of the third party(ies) providing the Activity and contact the applicable third party(ies) if you have any concerns or questions. Backflip is not responsible for any third party providing any Activity, or the information collected by such third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Advertising </strong></p>
<p>We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Apps. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to our Apps and other applications, your IP address, your ISP, or your DID, ADID, or another unique ID. They do this using cookies, clear gifs, or other similar technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Apps and the other applications and online services tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear gifs in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><a name="section4"></a><strong>4. WHO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:</p>
<ul>
<li>to our <strong>group companies</strong>, <strong>third party service providers </strong>(such as data analytics providers and hosting providers) and <strong>partners</strong> (such as our advertising partners, in the case of personal information of users who are not children) who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Apps), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Policy or that you (and your parent or guardian, if you are a child) are notified of when we collect your personal information.</li>
<li>to any <strong>competent law enforcement body, regulatory body, government agency, court or other third party </strong>where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.</li>

</ul>
<p>Our Apps may also enable users who are not children to post content to Social Networking Sites, as described in the section under the heading <a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section13"><strong>“Information We Collect From Third Parties”</strong></a> above. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those websites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of each such Social Networking Site. We are not and will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such Social Networking Sites; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such Social Networking Sites; or (iii) your use of any such Social Networking Sites.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><a name="section5"></a><strong>5. OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION (FOR EEA VISITORS)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are a user from the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above depends on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (such as our <a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/termsofservice/">Terms of Service</a>), (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent (or your parent or guardian’s consent, if you are a child) to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>
<p>If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our Apps, or communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate interests and will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>
<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “<a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section12"><strong>How to contact us</strong></a>” heading below.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><a name="section6"></a><strong>6. HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We use and periodically review our technical and organisational security measures in an effort to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. For example, Backflip strives to provide only those employees performing a legitimate business function with access to users’ personal information.</p>
<p>Despite our efforts, please be aware that no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. To that end, Backflip will notify users of a data breach when Backflip determines that is reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><a name="section7"></a><strong>7. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different than the laws of your country. If you are a user from the EEA and we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take appropriate steps to ensure that any personal information relating to you will continue to be adequately protected. Other than the disclosures referred to in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personal information without your permission.</p>
<p>Our servers are located in the United States, and our group companies and service providers and partners operate in the United States, Europe, and in countries outside of the EEA. This means that when we collect your personal information, we or others may process it in any of these countries.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><a name="section8"></a><strong>8. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We retain personal information we collect from you for legitimate business purposes, and/or as long as is reasonably necessary to provide you with access to our Apps or our other products or services. Backflip will also retain your information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><a name="section9"></a><strong>9. YOUR CHOICES AND RIGHTS TO YOUR INFORMATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to <strong>access, correct, update or request deletion</strong> of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “<a href="http://www.transformersearthwars.com/#section12"><strong>How to contact us</strong></a>” heading below.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

You acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of Your Content, including without limitation chat, text, or voice communications. In the event that Backflip pre-screens, refuses or removes any Content, you acknowledge that Backflip will do so for Backflip’s benefit, not yours.

<p><strong>3.2. Public Forums; Your Content</strong></p>
<p>(a)<strong> Public Discourse. </strong>The Backflip Properties may include various forums, blogs and chat features (“<strong>Forums</strong>”) where you can post Content, including, but not limited to, your observations and comments on designated topics. Backflip cannot guarantee that other Users will not use the ideas and information that you share. Therefore, if you have an idea or information that you would like to keep confidential and/or do not want others to use, do not post it on the Backflip Properties.

When you disclose information or rely on any information in the Forums, you do so at your own risk. Backflip reserves the right to, but has no obligation to, monitor the Forums, or any postings or other materials that you or other users transmit or post on the Forums, to alter or remove any such materials, and to disclose such materials and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to any third party in order to operate the Service properly or to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. Furthermore, you acknowledge that a large volume of information is available in these Forums and that people participating in such Forums may occasionally post message or make statements, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that are inaccurate, misleading, deceptive, abusive or even unlawful. Backflip neither endorses nor is responsible for such messages or statements, or for any opinion, advice, information or other utterance made or displayed in the Forums by you or the other users. The opinions expressed in the Forums reflect solely the opinions of you and/or the other users and may not reflect the opinions of Backflip. Backflip is not responsible for any errors or omissions in postings, for hyperlinks embedded in messages or for any results obtained from the use of the information contained in the Forums. Under no circumstances will Backflip be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on the information in the Forums or your use of the Forums.</p>
<p>(b)<strong> Your Content</strong></p>
<p>(i) License to Your Content. You hereby grant to Backflip an irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense and assign to third party) and right to copy, reproduce, fix, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, manufacture, commercialize, publish, distribute, sell, license, sublicense, transfer, lease, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, or provide access to electronically, broadcast, communicate to the public by telecommunication, display, perform, enter into computer memory, and use and practice, in any way, Your Content as well as all modified and derivative works of Your Content in connection with our provision of the Backflip Properties, including marketing and promotions of the Backflip Properties.</p>
<p>(ii) Waiver of Moral Rights. Except as prohibited by law, you waive any rights of attribution and/or any moral rights you may have in Your Content, regardless of whether Your Content is altered or changed in any manner.</p>
<p>(iii) Ownership of Your Content. Backflip does not claim any ownership rights in Your Content and nothing in these Terms of Use is intended to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit Your Content. Backflip has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights in or to Your Content.</p>
<p>(iv) Ownership of Other Content. Except with respect to Your Content, you agree that you have no right or title in or to any Content that appears on or in the Backflip Properties, including, but not limited to, the virtual goods or currency appearing or originating in any Backflip game, whether earned in a game or purchased from Backflip, or any other attributes associated with an Account or stored on or in the Backflip Properties. Backflip prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of virtual property effectuated outside the Backflip Properties, or the purported sale, lease, gift or trade in the “real world” of anything that appears or originates in the Backflip Properties. Accordingly, you may not trade, sell, or attempt to sell in-game items or currency for “real” money, or exchange those items or currency for value of any kind outside the game. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and will subject your Account to termination.</p>
<p>(c)<strong> User Interactions</strong></p>
<p>(i) Interactions with Other Users. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of the Backflip Properties and any other parties with whom you interact through the Backflip Properties. Backflip reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with these disputes. You will fully cooperate with Backflip to investigate any suspected unlawful, fraudulent or improper activity, including, but not limited to, granting Backflip access to any password-protected portions of your Account.</p>
<p>(ii) Release. If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release Backflip (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says:</p>
<p>A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Fees</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1. Purchases</strong></p>
<p>(a) <strong>Virtual Currency &amp; Virtual Items</strong>. In the Services, you may purchase, with “real world” money, a license to use (a) “virtual currency,” including, but not limited to, virtual coins, cash, tokens or points, all for use in Backflip games (“<strong>Virtual Currency</strong>”); (b) “virtual in-game items” (together with “Virtual Currency,” “<strong>Virtual Items</strong>”); and (c) other goods or services (“<strong>Merchandise</strong>”). You may also obtain a license to use Virtual Items by redeeming third-party virtual currency such as Facebook Credits. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF THIRD-PARTY VIRTUAL CURRENCY MADE THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. Backflip prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of virtual property effectuated outside of the Services, or the purported sale, lease, gift or trade in the “real world” of anything that appears or originates in the Services. Accordingly, you may not trade, sell or attempt to sell in-game items or currency for “real” money, or exchange those items or currency for value of any kind outside of a game. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and will subject your Account to termination.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>Not Legal Tender</strong>. Virtual Currency does not expire. There are no dormancy or other fees applicable to Virtual Currency. Virtual Currency may only be redeemed toward the purchase of Virtual Items or Merchandise. Backflip may, in its sole discretion, permit users to redeem Virtual Currency balances for its cash value, or replace it with new Virtual Currency at no cost to the User. Virtual Currency is not legal tender and cannot be reloaded, resold, transferred for value, redeemed for cash (except as described above) or applied to any other Account, except to the extent described herein, or as required by applicable law. VIRTUAL ITEMS AND MERCHANDISE CAN NEVER BE REDEEMED FOR REAL MONEY, GOODS, OR ANY OTHER ITEM OF MONETARY VALUE FROM BACKFLIP OR ANY OTHER PARTY. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT OR TITLE IN VIRTUAL ITEMS OR MERCHANDISE. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF THIRD PARTY VIRTUAL CURRENCY MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>EU Users</strong>. If you are a consumer who resides in the European Union, you have the right to cancel the purchase of a license to use Virtual Items and Merchandise within seven (7) working days after the date of purchase (“<strong>Cooling Off Period</strong>”). However, this right to cancel is lost once if the supply of the Virtual Items or Merchandise begins before the end of the Cooling Off Period. As the supply of the Virtual Items and Merchandise begins promptly after you purchase a license for Virtual Items and Merchandise, you acknowledge that by agreeing to purchase any such license you lose your right of cancellation.</p>
<p><strong>4.2. Payment of Fees</strong>. You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to you. Backflip may revise the pricing for the goods and services offered through the Service at any time. Backflip may also provide links to other websites or third party services, some which may charge separate fees, which are not included in any fees that you may pay to Backflip. Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with third parties are your responsibility. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BACKFLIP IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</p>
<p><strong>5. Intellectual Property</strong></p>

<p><strong>6.

BACKFLIP DOES NOT WARRANT THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE AT THE TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING; THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE GAME OR THE SERVICE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>
<p>7.2 <strong>Disclaimer of Other Users</strong>. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS OF THE BACKFLIP PROPERTIES. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BACKFLIP DOES NOT MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE STATEMENTS OF USERS OF THE BACKFLIP PROPERTIES.</p>
<p><strong>8. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p>8.1 <strong>Exclusion. </strong>NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER OR EXCLUDE OR LIMIT ANY LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY ARISING FROM ANY NEGLIGENCE OF BACKFLIP, FRAUD OR FRAUDLENT MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE LEGALLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED.</p>
<p>8.2 <strong>Types of Damages</strong>. BACKFLIP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUES, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (HOWEVER SUCH LOSSES ARE QUALIFIED), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE SERVICE ITSELF, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT BACKFLIP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>8.3 <strong>Cap on Damages</strong>. SUBJECT TO SECTION 8.1, IN ALL EVENTS, BACKFLIP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO BACKFLIP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS OF USE IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT A CLAIM. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANYTHING TO BACKFLIP DURING SUCH TIME PERIOD, YOUR SOLE REMEDY (AND BACKFLIP’S EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY) FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH BACKFLIP IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICE AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.</p>
<p>8.4 <strong>User Content.</strong> THE BACKFLIP PARTIES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TIMELINESS, DELETION, MIS-DELIVERY OR FAILURE TO STORE ANY CONTENT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR CONTENT AND USER CONTENT), USER COMMUNICATIONS OR PERSONALIZATION SETTINGS.</p>
<p>8.5 <strong>Basis of the Bargain.</strong> THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN BACKFLIP AND YOU. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and limitations included in these Terms of Use may not apply to you. To the extent that Backflip may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit its liability as set forth in these Terms of Use, the scope of such warranty, and the extent of Backflip’s liability, shall be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>9. Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver; Waiver of Jury Trial</strong></p>
<p class="Legal2L2" align="left"><em>Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Backflip and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</em></p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.1 <strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</strong><em>.</em> All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms of Use or the use of any product or service provided by Backflip that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Backflip, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms of Use.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.2 <strong>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution</strong>. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“<strong>Notice</strong>”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Backflip should be sent to:</p>
<p>Backflip Studios</p>
<p>PO Box 7420</p>
<p>Boulder, CO 80306</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">After the Notice is received, you and Backflip may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Backflip do not resolve the claim or dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.3 <strong>Arbitration Rules</strong><em>. </em> Arbitration shall be initiated through the JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider (<strong>“ADR Provider”</strong>) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms of Use. The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.jamsadr.org or by calling the JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00 ) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you initiate an arbitration in which you seek less than $500 in damages and comply with the Terms of Use, including the Notice Requirement, Backflip shall reimburse you for your JAMS filing fee, and shall pay all administration and arbitrator fees up to a total amount of $500. If the Arbitrator grants you an award, Backflip will reimburse your attorneys’ fees.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.4 <strong>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration</strong>. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.5 <strong>Time Limits</strong>. If you or Backflip pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.6 <strong>Authority of Arbitrator</strong>. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Backflip, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the JAMS Rules, and the Terms of Use. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Backflip.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.7 <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial</strong>. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Backflip in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND BACKFLIP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.8 <strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</strong>. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.9 <strong>Confidentiality</strong>. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This Paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.10 <strong>Severability</strong><em>. </em>If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.11 <strong>Right to Waive</strong>. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or effect any other portion of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.12 <strong>Survival of Agreement</strong><em>. </em>This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Backflip.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.13 <strong>Small Claims Court</strong>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Backflip may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.14 <strong>Emergency Equitable Relief</strong><em>.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p class="Legal2L3" align="left">9.15 <strong>Courts</strong>. In any circumstances where the foregoing Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Denver County, Colorado, for such purpose.</p>
<p class="Legal2L1" align="left"><strong>10. </strong><strong>Term and Termination. </strong></p>
<p class="Legal2L2" align="left"><strong>10.1 Term.</strong> The Terms of Use commence on the date when you accept them (as described in the preamble above) and remain in full force and effect while you use the Backflip Properties, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Terms of Use.</p>

Backflip will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination, including for deletion of Your Content.
